# Yeet
A compiler from Aratar Bytecode (\*.prog) to various machine codes (or C, then GCC to machine code for platforms not supported yet).  One compiler to yeet them all!

This compiler relies on Aratar Bytecode that is generated by the yote IDE, or patches from the previous compiled version.  This allows for really quick compile times.
